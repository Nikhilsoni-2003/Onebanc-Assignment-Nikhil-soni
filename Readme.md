# Levenshtein / Edit Distance Algorithm

This project implements the **Levenshtein Distance** algorithm from scratch — both in **C++ (console)** and **JavaScript (browser)**. No libraries, no frameworks, no GenAI used.

---

## 📌 What's Levenshtein Distance?

It’s a dynamic programming algorithm that calculates the **minimum number of edits** (insert, delete, replace) to convert one string into another.  
Commonly used in spelling correction, DNA matching, NLP, etc.

## 🌐 JavaScript Web Version

- A simple webpage with two input boxes

- On clicking Calculate, it animates the matrix creation and shows the result

- Responsive design, styled with pure CSS

- Also includes a Try Again button to reset

## ▶️ How to use :

- Just open index.html in your browser and give it a try.

---

## 💻 C++ Version

- Takes two strings as input
- Builds the DP matrix and prints it to console
- Shows the final minimum edit distance
- Clean and beginner-friendly

### ▶️ How to use (C++ version):

1. **Compile the code:**
   ```sh
   g++ -o levenshtein levenshtein.cpp
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```sh
   ./levenshtein
   ```
3. **Follow the prompts:**
   - Enter the first string.
   - Enter the second string.
   - The program will display the edit distance matrix and the minimum edit distance.
